Multivariate Linear Regression
=================



Linear regression with `multiple variables` is  known as <b>multivariate linear regression</b> .

We now introduce `notation for equations` where we can have `any number of input variables`.

The `multivariable form of the hypothesis function` accommodating these multiple features is as follows:

hθ<sub>(x)</sub> = θ<sub>0</sub>+θ<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>+θ<sub>3</sub>x<sub>3</sub>+⋯+θ<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub>

In order to develop intuition about this function, we can think about <b>θ<sub>0</sub></b> as the `basic price of a house`, <b>θ<sub>1</sub></b> as the `price per square meter`, <b>θ<sub>2</sub></b> as the `price per floor`, etc. <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> will be the `number of square meters in the house`, <b>x<sub>2</sub></b> the `number of floors`, etc.

Using the definition of `matrix multiplication`, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as:

This is a `vectorization of our hypothesis function` for one training example .

Remark:

Note that for convenience reasons in this course we <b>assume x<sub>0</sub><sup>(i)</sup>=1 for (i∈1,...,m)</b>. 

This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and x. Hence making the two vectors 'θ' and x<sup>(i)</sup> match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: n+1).



**Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables**
-------------------------------------------

The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our 'n' features:



In other words:



The following image compares gradient descent with one variable to gradient descent with multiple variables:
