Multivariate Linear Regression
=================



Linear regression with `multiple variables` is  known as <b>multivariate linear regression</b> .

We now introduce `notation for equations` where we can have `any number of input variables`.

The `multivariable form of the hypothesis function` accommodating these multiple features is as follows:

hθ<sub>(x)</sub> = θ<sub>0</sub>+θ<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>+θ<sub>3</sub>x<sub>3</sub>+⋯+θ<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub>

In order to develop intuition about this function, we can think about <b>θ<sub>0</sub></b> as the `basic price of a house`, <b>θ<sub>1</sub></b> as the `price per square meter`, <b>θ<sub>2</sub></b> as the `price per floor`, etc. <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> will be the `number of square meters in the house`, <b>x<sub>2</sub></b> the `number of floors`, etc.

Using the definition of `matrix multiplication`, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as:

This is a `vectorization of our hypothesis function` for one training example .

Remark:

Note that for convenience reasons in this course we <b>assume x<sub>0</sub><sup>(i)</sup>=1 for (i∈1,...,m)</b>. 

This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and x. Hence making the two vectors 'θ' and x<sup>(i)</sup> match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: n+1).



**Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables**
-------------------------------------------

The gradient descent equation itself is generally `the same form` ; we just have to <b>repeat it for our 'n' features</b> :

Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling
================================================



We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.

The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally:

-1 ≤ x<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1

or

-0.5 ≤ x<sub>i</sub> ≤ 0.5

These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.

Two techniques to help with this are `feature scaling` and `mean normalization`. 

<b>Feature scaling</b> involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. 

<b>Mean normalization</b> involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. 

To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:

 x<sub>i</sub> : =  ( x<sub>i</sub> -  μ<sub>i</sub> ) / s<sub>i</sub>

Where <b>μ<sub>i</sub></b> is the `average` of all the values for feature (i) and <b>s<sub>i</sub></b> is the range of values (max - min), or <b>s<sub>i</sub></b> is the standard deviation.

**Note that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results.** 


For example, if <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> represents housing prices with a `range of 100 to 2000` and a `mean value of 1000` , then, <b> x<sub>i</sub> := (price-1000)/1900 </b> .
