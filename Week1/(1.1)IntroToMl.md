<h1> Introduction to Machine Learning </h1>




What is Machine Learning?
-------------------------

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. 

`Arthur Samuel` described it as: 
 >"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
  
This is an older, informal definition.

`Tom Mitchell` provides a more modern definition:
>"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

<b>Example: playing checkers.</b>

* E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

* T = the task of playing checkers.

* P = the probability that the program will win the next game.


In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
* `Supervised Learning` is when we teach a machine to do something
* `Unsupervised learning` is when it learns by itself


You might also hear other ghost terms such as `reinforcement learning` and
`recommender systems`.
These are other types of machine learning algorithms but the two most use types of learning algorithms are probably supervised
learning and unsupervised learning
