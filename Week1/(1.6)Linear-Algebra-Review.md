Matrices and Vectors
====================

<b>Matrices</b> are `2-dimensional arrays`:

```

    [ a b c ]        
A = [ d e f ]    
    [ g h i ] 
    [ j k l ]

```

The above matrix has four rows and three columns, so it is a 4 x 3 matrix.

A <b>vector</b> is a `matrix with one column` and many rows:

```
    [a]
B = [b]
    [c]
    [d]
```
    

So `vectors are a subset of matrices`. The above vector is a 4 x 1 matrix.

**Notation and terms**:

-   <b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> refers to the `element in the ith row and jth column` of matrix A.
-   <b>A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.</b>
-   <b>v<sub>i</sub></b> refers to the `element in the ith row` of the vector.
-   In general, all our `vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed`. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.
-   <b>Matrices</b> are usually denoted by `uppercase names` while <b>vectors</b> are `lowercase`.
-   <b>Scalar</b> means that an object is a `single value` , not a vector or matrix.
-   <b>R</b> refers to the set of `scalar real numbers`.
-   <b>R<sup>n</sup></b> refers to the set of `n-dimensional vectors of real numbers`.
