<h1> Unsupervised Learning </h1>


Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can `derive structure` from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by `clustering` the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is `no feedback` based on the prediction results.

<h2>Example:</h2>

<b>Clustering</b>: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

<b>Non-clustering</b>: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a [cocktail party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)).
